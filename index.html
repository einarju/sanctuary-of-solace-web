            Each session is tailored to your story. These modalities peel back layers of conditioning and stress,
            tracking the energy to the source of old patterns, trauma, addiction, physical, mental, emotional pain and
            suffering; some which may not even be yours, but may be tracked back to and through your ancestral lineage, 
            the womb, past lives and even the land on which you live. It is by identifying the source of these issues,
            acknowledging, releasing, healing and transforming this energy that enables you to change your energetic
            blueprint. Energy can never be destroyed, but it can be changed. It doesn't mean you will forget, but it
            will enable you to understand what's yours and what is not, and the reason for the event, see it from a 
            higher perspective and to look at them objectively, and react differently in the future.
          </p>

          <p>
            These are not hollow words. These words I write are truth, my truth. From the one who has walked the path,
            experienced the terrors of the night and fears that plagued the day, to the point that one no longer wanted
            to exist in any form; in this life or the next, but to vanish into the abyss of non-existence. To the one
            who experienced, no-one will ever know or comprehend this long and lonely journey. Today, this one stands
            in the light, without the terrors and fears, without the shackles of trauma caused to the ancestral lineage,
            the womb, life and land, all woven so intricately within the energy field. Looking back, no greater honour
            has it been than to heal my ancestral lineage, of those gone before me, those coming after me and to our land.

              A "healer" never heals anyone directly. A "healer" gives off a vibration representing the healed state and channels
              sacred divine energy from source by whatever technique they prefer. It is up to the person requiring the healing to
              match that frequency in order to heal themselves. It is the responsibility of the person requiring healing to accept
              the "healers" energy and match that frequency by mirroring that energy and/or accepting the channelled sacred divine
              source energy in order to heal themselves.

          </p>

          <p>
            Hi, my name is James and you are welcome to my website. Growing up in the countryside, spending most of my days in 
            nature and with animals I feel it significantly contributed to my sensitivity to energy. I consider myself as a 
            compassionate, empathic, intuitive and sensitive being. I believe that everything is created equal and that we were 
            created to be happy and healthy, to enjoy life with the responsibility as caretakers of this beautiful planet that 
            has been gifted to us. I believe each illness and dis-ease is caused by emotions, traumas and environmental imbalances 
            from this lifetime, past lives and/or inherited through our ancestral linage and energy fields as well as the land 
            and environment we live in.
          </p>

          <p>
            It is my belief that no-one should be a slave to their past, for we are all on our own individual journey in an 
            intricate web of life, walking each other home and doing the best we can with the experience, knowledge and awareness 
            we have at any particular time.
          </p>

          <p>
            I have always been drawn to spirituality, the unseen, the mysteries of life and the universe. I loved being 
            surrounded by nature, observing and learning from the world we live in. I have always been interested in complimentary 
            and natural healing methods, remedies, energy and the universe, learning and understanding the origins of our issues, 
            hurts, traumas or pain held within our physical, emotional, mental and spiritual bodies. Whether the origin be of our 
            own making, our ancestral lineage, womb trauma, environmental or other.
          </p>

          <p>
            I have considerable knowledge and living experiences of mental, emotional and spiritual pain, personal, ancestral 
            trauma and the impact of traumatised land can have on our behaviour, physical, emotional, mental and spiritual health 
            which is more often the source of our illnesses, dis-ease and pain.
          </p>

          <p>
            I believe that we have been gifted with the power and tools to heal ourselves, our ancestral energy lines and the planet 
            of every illness and dis-ease, whether this is through plant medicine, crystals, sound, colour, animals or energy 
            healing etc. With the help of these tools, I believe that we all have the ability to heal ourselves.
          </p>

          <p>
            Everything is energy and we are far more than our physical bodies. The mind, body and spirit trilogy is a fascinating 
            and powerful creation with extraordinary potential. We hold all the emotional, physical, spiritual, memory and belief 
            system blueprints, as well as genetic records of this lifetime, past lifetimes and our ancestral lineage. These elements 
            have a complete intricate intelligence of their own, which must be able to support each other equally to create balance 
            and wholeness in order for us to function, survive and thrive.
          </p>

          <p>
            In order to heal, we must also acknowledge and forgive ourselves and others without judgement for the parts we have 
            played in our own story. I also believe that we must acknowledge and without judgement, forgive our ancestors, 
            regardless of whether we are conscious of their story which we have inherited. We are not always aware of the extent 
            of their story or truth, but without them, we would not be here. While forgiveness may be difficult, I believe the 
            power of compassion, love and forgiveness can bring us and the world back to balance and wholeness and bring us to 
            freedom to live a happier, balanced and healthy life.
          </p>

          <p>
            It is my belief that no-one heals another. The whole universe and the Source of all creation is within each one of us 
            and that our healing comes from within our own selves as we are aspects and particles of Source, Universal Consciousness 
            and all that is.
          </p>

          <p>
            It should be noted that we are all responsible for our own healing. This can be painful as we delve into the shadows 
            we don't want to see or experience, but I believe no-one should have to do it alone. Therefore, as a practitioner and 
            facilitator I will hold sacred space for you, to help you heal your emotional, mental, physical and spiritual pain, 
            peel back the many layers of conditioning, reclaim your power, your authenticity, your sovereignty and facilitate you 
            in your own healing of mind, body and spirit and to help you regain control of your life. I can help you embrace your 
            inner beauty and live your life to the full, the life you came here to live.
          </p>

          <p>
            I have travelled that road less travelled, walked the windy path with many avenue and forks in the road, came face to 
            face with the deepest of darkness, and conquered many battles along the way. As a result of this, I can now show the 
            way to anyone willing to take this road, and this journey is an endless unravelling to return to the self. This journey 
            has led me to become advocate of psychological, emotional, spiritual and physical wellbeing, to identify and find a 
            sense of self, self-acceptance, self-love and belonging, to reclaim "the self", who we are at the core of our true 
            essence. This ignited my passion to become a holistic practitioner and to be the best service that I can be.
          </p>

          <p>
            As an advocate for wellbeing, of mind body and spirit and a holistic practitioner, I also have my own story, my own 
            journey which has brought me to becoming a holistic practitioner and be of the greatest service to others I can be. 
            We are all living our own story, walking the same road, yet on different paths, walking each other home, to the great 
            Universal Source of all that is, the great Creator of all that exists and of all that is to come.
          </p>

          <p>
            It is on this journey that I came across a beautiful quote by Jim Cogley, wood artist and phycologist which I would 
            like to share with you:
          </p>

          <p class="mini-quote">
            "We cannot bring anyone further than we have gone ourselves and in a similar way, we should never expect anyone to 
            engage in work we have not done or experienced ourselves" — Jim Cogley, wood artist and phycologist.
          </p>

          <p>
            My wish for you is to enable you to transform your life, to enable you be your authentic self, to feel confident, 
            happy and live a fulfilled life, to <strong>Free your Spirit and reclaim your True Essence</strong>.

              <p><strong>Ancient Origins of Crystal Healing</strong></p>
              <p>
                Crystal healing practices originated in ancient civilisations, such as Ancient Lemuria, Atlantis, Mesopotamia, Egypt, India and China where crystals were used for protection, spiritual purposes, and to enhance well-being. Crystals were also used, and continue to be used today in many ancient traditional cultures such as the Mayans, Shaman Medicine people across many continents including the Indigenous of Peru and North America. Crystal healing has been built on these ancient practices and traditions over thousands of years and incorporated concepts such as ancient traditional rituals, chakras from Hindu-Buddhist philosophy and chi from Chinese traditions.

              <p><strong>What is Crystal Healing?</strong></p>
              <p>
                Crystal healing is a natural energy healing therapy that carried out with the assistance of the Angelic-Elemental beings of Holy Light and Love, Archangel Sandalphon who is the Prince and Governor of the Angelic-Elemental Kingdom. Crystal healing is channelled from the Source of all life with the assistance of Angels, Spirit Guides and the clients Higher Self through the practitioner to the client with the use of crystals placed on various parts of the clients body. It gently balances life energies and brings health and well-being to the client. This is a non-invasive healing therapy which works to promote health and well-being of the physical, emotional and spiritual bodies.
              </p>

              <p><strong>What should I expect in a Crystal Healing Session?</strong></p>
              <p>
                Prior to a crystal healing session, I will tune in with Spirit, my Spirit guides and your Spirit guides, angels, your higher self, tuning into your energy field to seek guidance.
              </p>
              <p>
                Before you arrive, I will have opened Sacred Space and have the space cleansed and Spiritually protected. Upon your arrival, you will be required to complete a New Client Consultation form and have a brief discussion of the issues you wish to address, all of which will be confidential. If it is your second or subsequent session, I will complete a client session sheet to monitor your progress. You will then lie face up on the massage table/plinth (fully clothed) where I will enter your auric energy field, scan your body with my hands hovering over your energy field after which I will commence crystal healing placing specific crystals on the areas of the body that is required.
              </p>
              <p>
                At the end of the healing session, I will remove the crystals and their connection to you, clear your aura and perform grounding, ensuring you are present and back in your body before leaving.
              </p>

              <p><strong>How does Crystal Healing work?</strong></p>
              <p>
                As a Crystal Healing Practitioner, I will not use my own personal energy, I will only use Angelic Elemental of Holy Light and Love, and Devine healing energy. I will take in the Angelic Elemental Holy Light and Love, Devine healing energy through my crown chakra, into my heart chakra and direct this healing energy out through my hands and channel the healing energy through the crystals which enhances and magnifies healing energy into your energy field.
              </p>
              <p>
                The above will depend on guidance and direction from Source Spirit before or during the healing session.
              </p>
              <p>
                Crystal healing automatically balances the blocked energy pathways within the physical, emotional, mental and spiritual bodies/or charge the chakras. Following the crystal healing session, the healing energy becomes integrated into your energy field and over the following three to five days where more may be released from the your energy field and the process is then repeated.
              </p>

              <p><strong>How often should I receive Crystal Healing?</strong></p>
              <p>
                It is recommended to receive a minimum of six healing sessions, one healing session per week for a minimum of six consecutive weeks to work through the particular issue. Each issue is different and depending on the issue, length of time and dept of the issue, more than six healing session may be required to work through the issue. However, it is always the persons decision on how many sessions they receive.

              <p>
                The Reiki Principles are the main traits that the Traditional Japanese Reiki Practitioner would have lived by. They are also applicable as far back as one hundred years ago as they are today.
              </p>

              <p><strong>Tera-Mai Reiki</strong></p>
              <p>
                Reiki is a Japanese word that means Universal Energy. In Japan over 100 years ago, Dr. Usui was given initiations into healing in a consciousness-raising experience he had. The proof of his experience was that the "Reiki" initiations he was given worked.
              </p>
              <p>
                Tera Mai Reiki is a natural energy healing therapy that is channelled from the Source of all life with the assistance of Angels, Spirit Guides and the clients Higher Self through the practitioner to the client. It gently balances life energies and brings health and well-being, focusing on the seven major chakras, spin points, vents and the aura. This is a non-invasive healing therapy which works to promote health and well-being of the physical, emotional and spiritual bodies.
              </p>
              <p>
                During Reiki I call in the universal life healing energy from Source of Light and Love, Father/Mother God. I never use my own personal energy. I always use Divine healing energy. I take in this healing energy through my crown chakra into the heart chakra and out through the hands, channelling the energy into the recipients energy field.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Reiki energy becomes integrated into the energy field of the client over three to five days. After the fifth day, more sludge energy is released from the energy field of the client.
              </p>

              <p><strong>Tera Mai Reiki Seichem</strong></p>
              <p>
                Traditional Reiki Seichem passes down fire energy with the grounding qualities of Earth (Reiki). Eera-Mai TM Seichem Practitioners are initiated into all four elements of Earth Fire, Water and Air.
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Earth (Reiki)</strong> healing energy grounds all other healing energies</li>
                <li><strong>Fire (Sakara)</strong> works in the aura as well as the physical body</li>
                <li><strong>Water (Sophi-EI)</strong> brings up deep emotional issues for healing</li>
                <li><strong>Air (Angelic-light)</strong> is a two-fold energy of air and Spirit. It aids in psychological healing. It also enhances the power of the third-eye and the spoken word. The Practitioner and the Client can often experience the presence of Angels.</li>
              </ul>

              <p><strong>Psychic Surgery</strong></p>
              <p>
                Psychic surgery utilises other rays of touch healing. It is a non-invasive profound and transformative healing technique within the realm of Reiki which as with all non-conventional treatment, complements conventional medical treatments. It is a spiritual practice that aims to channel universal life force energy for healing and well-being. Unlike conventional surgery, psychic surgery operates on an energetic level. It may target imbalances, blockages and physical issues in the body and its subtle energy system. Psychic surgery in Reiki is a profound and intuitive process. It involves the Reiki practitioner using their third-eye and hands to perceive and manipulate the subtle energy system of the client. The practitioner tunes into the universal life force energy, their intuition and Spirit guides, identifies areas of the body with imbalances, blockages or physical issue the client presents themselves with. Using gentle hand movements and visual tools provided by the practitioners Spirit guides, the practitioner may manipulate or remove the negative energy or dissolve the physical issue the client presents themselves with and restore balance to the area which may further promote balance and healing to the client.
              </p>

              <p><strong>How does Reiki work?</strong></p>
              <p>
                As a Reiki Practitioner, I will not use my own personal energy, I will only use Devine healing energy. I will take in the Devine energy healing through my crown chakra, into my heart chakra and direct this healing out through my hands and channel the healing energy into your energy field. I may also channel Reiki healing through the following, depending on the issue you would like to work through and direction from Spirit and my Spirit Guides:-
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>My eyes</li>
                <li>My breath</li>
                <li>My heart chakra</li>
              </ul>

              <p>I may also carry out:-</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Reiki healing for the Aura</li>
                <li>Finger laser healing</li>
                <li>Ball of light (time delay) healing</li>
                <li>Energetic massage</li>
                <li>Patting with the hands and fingers</li>
                <li>Hand coning for chakra healing</li>
                <li>Vacuuming negative energy</li>
                <li>Blood cleansing</li>
                <li>Use various sacred healing symbols</li>
                <li>Reiki Seichem</li>
              </ul>

              <p>
                The above will depend on guidance and direction from Source Spirit before or during the healing session.
              </p>

              <p><strong>Benefits of Reiki</strong></p>
              <p>
                Reiki healing automatically balances the blocked energy pathways within the physical, emotional, mental and spiritual bodies. It can be effective in providing relief from pain, anxiety and other emotional and physical discomforts and illnesses. Following a Reiki healing session, the healing energy becomes integrated into the energy field of the client over the following three to five days. After the fifth day, more stagnant energy may be released from the clients energy field. The release of stagnant and negative energy is gently released from the client over this period.
              </p>
              <p>
                Many people come for Reiki healing due to the following issues/stresses:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>Physical</li>

                <li>Spiritual</li>
                <li>Psychological</li>
                <li>Burnout</li>
                <li>Stress</li>
                <li>Feeling stuck/stagnant/lack of direction</li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                The above is not exhaustible.
              </p>
              <p>

                Everything in the Universe vibrates at a certain frequence, the earth, moon, stars and all that exists. Everything is a vibration, our bodies have a whole number of rhythms, nothing stays still. The motion generates frequencies which then generate sound, resulting in everything, including the cells in our bodies having a resonate sound and frequence even though it may not be heard by the human ear.

                Sound therapy, or sound healing, uses sound waves and vibrations to promote deep relaxation, reduce stress, and improve overall well-being. Based on the principle that everything in the universe vibrates at a unique frequency, it aims to bring a person's natural resonance back into healthy balance by using therapeutic sounds from instruments like singing bowls, gongs, chimes, drums and voice. Benefits can include improved sleep, emotional release, and enhanced physical and mental health.

              <p><strong>Origins of Sound Healing Therapy</strong></p>
              <p>
                Sound Healing Therapy is one of the oldest forms of healing known to mankind. Almost every culture has used sound and vibration for healing and transformation, from Ancient Egypt, Greek, Mayans, Babylonians, Romans, Native Indigenous of the Americas, China, Aboriginal, Celts and more.
              </p>
              <p>
                Many cultures around the world have been using Sound as a powerful healing tool for thousands of years and 'Doctors' in ancient Greece used vibration to aid in digestion, treat mental disturbance, and induce sleep.
              </p>
              <p>
                Sound therapy has origins in ancient practices worldwide, including the Aboriginal people in Australian who used didgeridoo for healing, Tibetan and yogic traditions using singing bowls, the human voice with mantra chants, and the ancient Greek concepts of sound for balance and harmony. Modern sound healing began in the middle of the 20th century with pioneers like English osteopath Sir Peter Guy Manners, who researched audible voice frequencies for therapeutic effects.
              </p>

              <p><strong>Ancient Cultures and Sound Healing</strong></p>

              <p><strong>Aboriginal Australian Culture:-</strong></p>
              <p>
                Around 40,000 years ago, Aboriginal Australians used the didgeridoo to heal various ailments, making it one of the earliest documented cultures to use sound healing.
              </p>

              <p><strong>Tibetan and Indian Traditions:-</strong></p>
              <p>
                Monks in Tibet and Nepal used singing bowls in spiritual and healing ceremonies. Yogic traditions incorporate mantras and bija (seed syllables) to stimulate organ systems and promote healing.
              </p>

              <p><strong>Greek Philosophy:-</strong></p>
              <p>
                The ancient Greeks, including Pythagoras, explored the therapeutic effects of music and sound, using harmonious musical intervals to promote balance and health. Apollo was the god associated with both music and healing.
              </p>

              <p><strong>Chinese Traditions:-</strong></p>
              <p>
                In Chinese Qigong, specific sounds and mantras are used to stimulate and harmonise the body's internal organ systems.
              </p>

              <p><strong>Egyptian Practices:-</strong></p>
              <p>
                Ancient Egyptians also recognised the power of sound and music, incorporating it into healing practices.
              </p>

              <p><strong>Islamic Hospitals:-</strong></p>
              <p>
                Hospitals in the medieval Islamic world, such as the Al-Mansuri Hospital in Cairo, regularly used music and sound therapy, particularly for mental illnesses.
              </p>

              <p><strong>Shaman Medicine People:-</strong></p>
              <p>
                Shamans use sound healing to induce trance states for healing and spiritual journeys by employing instruments like drums and rattles to create rhythmic vibrations, which help alter consciousness, connect with Spirit guides, and facilitate physical, emotional, and spiritual healing. They utilise specific frequencies, chants, and resonant tools such as singing bowls and flutes to promote deep states of relaxation, release blockages, and create a sacred space for powerful energetic healing.
              </p>

              <p><strong>Modern Development:-</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Sir Peter Guy Manners:-</strong></p>
              <p>
                In the mid-20th century, English Osteopath Sir Peter Guy Manners pioneered sound as a medical practice in the West. He researched the effects of audible voice frequencies and discovered hundreds of healing frequencies associated with specific body parts.
              </p>
              <p>
                In recent decades, sound healing has gained popularity in Western cultures, with modern scientific studies showing promising results for stress reduction, anxiety relief, and mood improvement.

              <p>
                This therapy can be used alone or alongside my existing Body and Energy Therapies for an even deeper level of healing. Sound can help to cleanse and comforts in a cocoon of healing sound and vibration which shifts the brain from Beta (waking state) to Theta or Delta (meditation state) through vibration and the use of various sound healing instruments.
              </p>
              <p>
                Sound and vibrational energy and emotion are all deeply connected and so Sound and Vibrational healing energy can benefit, not only on a physical level, moving and releasing energy and trauma trapped in our cells, but also on an emotional and energetic level. Human emotions have their immediate expression through sound and vibration, and it is often the repression of the emotions that creates emotional blockages. Sound and vibration can be used to unlock the blocked emotions and release them creating energy shifts in the physical, emotional and auric bodies.
              </p>
              <p>
                Sound and vibration healing has many benefits including re-balancing the physical, emotional and spiritual bodies, relief from stress and anxiety, regenerates the parasympathetic nervous system, awakens higher states of consciousness, stimulating the circulatory and glandular systems, improving sleep, increasing vital energy flow (Chi), improving creativity, intuition and motivation.
              </p>

              <p><strong>Stress and Anxiety Reduction:-</strong></p>
              <p>
                The calming effect of sound waves helps to reduce stress and promote a state of deep rest.
              </p>

              <p><strong>Improved Sleep:-</strong></p>
              <p>
                Many people experience better sleep quality after sound healing sessions.
              </p>

              <p><strong>Emotional Release:-</strong></p>
              <p>
                Sound therapy can provide a safe way to tap into and release emotions, contributing to emotional well-being.
              </p>

              <p><strong>Enhanced Well-being:-</strong></p>
              <p>
                The combination of relaxation, stress reduction, and potential physical benefits fosters a sense of overall balance and harmony.
              </p>

              <p><strong>Pain Reduction:-</strong></p>
              <p>
                Some studies have shown that the sound of singing bowls can be metabolised in the body as endogenous opioids, acting as an internal pain reliever.
              </p>

              <p><strong>Vibrational Effects of Sound</strong></p>
              <p>Pleasant, harmonious rich in overtone vibration.</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Human Body – 70% to 80% water, therefore, transmits vibration very well.</li>
                <li>In air, sound travels at 340 metres per second (760mph). In water, sound travels at 1,500 metres per second (3,350mph).</li>
                <li>100 trillion cells in the human body all vibrate at a frequency.</li>
                <li>Vibration continues through the skin, tissues, cavities, organs and bones.</li>
              </ul>

              <p><strong>Sound Healing Therapy uses</strong></p>

              <p><strong>Vibrational Resonance:-</strong></p>
              <p>
                The core idea of sound healing is that the body has its own natural frequency. When this frequency is disrupted by stress, illness, or other factors, the body becomes out of tune, leading to dis-ease.
              </p>

              <p><strong>Restoring Harmony:-</strong></p>
              <p>
                Sound therapy uses external frequencies to help bring the body's natural resonances back into a state of balance and harmony.
              </p>

              <p><strong>Brainwave Regulation:-</strong></p>
              <p>
                The soothing vibrations and tones can slow down brainwave patterns, lower heart rate, and calm the nervous system, promoting deep relaxation.
              </p>

              <p><strong>Energy Flow:-</strong></p>
              <p>
                In some practices, sound waves are directed at specific energy centers (chakras) and along meridians (energy lines) in the body to improve the flow of vital life-force energy, known as Qi.
              </p>

              <p><strong>Instruments and Practices</strong></p>

              <p><strong>Singing Bowls:-</strong></p>
              <p>
                Tibetan and crystal singing bowls are popular, with their vibrations said to balance chakras and clear energy blockages, creating resonant vibrations that promote relaxation, focus, and a higher sense of peace.
              </p>

              <p><strong>Gongs:-</strong></p>
              <p>
                Used for their powerful sound. Gongs can provide deep resonance and relaxation.
              </p>

              <p><strong>Chimes and Drums:-</strong></p>
              <p>
                Koshi chimes and shaman drums are also used to create therapeutic soundscapes.
              </p>

              <p><strong>Sound Baths:-</strong></p>
              <p>
                A common format where practitioners create a "bath" of sound and vibration for participants to relax and immerse themselves in.
              </p>

              <p><strong>Drums:-</strong></p>
              <p>
                Used to create a rhythmic, heartbeat-like sound associated with the earth and physical healing, helping to enter a deep meditative state.
              </p>

              <p><strong>Rattles:-</strong></p>
              <p>
                Produce a shaking, rhythmic sound that can stimulate the nervous system, promote movement and flow, and help release blocked emotions.
              </p>

              <p><strong>Flutes and other instruments:-</strong></p>
              <p>
                Lyres, flutes, and gongs are also used to create resonant sounds for healing and to enhance the sacredness of a ritual.
              </p>

              <p><strong>Chanting and singing:-</strong></p>
              <p>
                The human voice itself is a powerful tool for producing resonant frequencies that create a healing environment.
              </p>

              <p><strong>Specific frequencies:-</strong></p>
              <p>
                Shamans work with sounds that align with natural harmonic frequencies, similar to the concept of binaural beats in modern sound healing, to promote biological and mental vitality.
              </p>

                <p class="quote">
                  Since ancient times, music and sound has been recognised for its therapeutic value. Greek physicians used flutes, lyres, and zithers to heal their patients. They used vibration to aid in digestion, treat mental disturbance, and induce sleep. Aristotle (373–323 BCE). Dr. Assad Meymandi - The National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) in 2009

              </div>

              <p>
                In his famous book 'De Anima' Dr Assad Meymandi wrote that "flute music could arouse strong emotions and purify the soul. Ancient Egyptians describe musical incantations for healing the sick."
              </p>

              <p><strong>How do singing bowls help in the healing process?</strong></p>
              <p>
                Illness can be descripted as dis-harmony within the body, an imbalance in the cells or an organ. When there is a blockage, the organ stops vibrating at a healthy frequence, and results in some form of illness. Using sound, one can break-up, dissolve and remove these blockages.
              </p>
              <p>
                Sound from Tibetan Singing Bowls entrain the brain to move into the Theta brain waive (4-8hz), that induces deep meditative and peaceful states, clarity of mind and intuition.
              </p>
              <p>
                The sound vibrations impact our nervous system, engaging our relaxation reflex and inhibiting the stress or pain response. Through listening and absorbing vibrations of Tibetan Singing Bowls, one's internal dialogue, the "inner critic" is quietened. Their sound synchronises brain waves and enhances awareness of mind-body connection.
              </p>

              <div class="quote-block">
                <p class="quote">
                  Just like when a stone is dropped into a pond, concentric waves spread over the water's surface. Every molecule of the water is set moving. During sound massage, something similar happens with our bodies, for it consists of 80% liquid. The gentle sound waves spread through liquid in tissues, muscles, tendons, bones, cavities and organs. These "waves" stimulate the entire body, allowing for tension and blockages to clear away. The more the body is free of tension, the further spreading the sound.

              <p><strong>What should I expect in a Sound Healing Session?</strong></p>
              <p>
                Before you arrive, I will have opened Sacred Space and have the space cleansed. Upon your arrival, you will be required to complete a New Client Consultation form and have a brief discussion of the issues you wish to address, all of which will be confidential. If it is your second or subsequent session, I will include any additional information provided to your consultation form. You will then lie face down on the massage table/plinth (fully clothed) where I will proceed to perform the treatment, placing the sound therapy bowls on various parts of the body. You will then lie face up, where I will also place the sound therapy bowls on various parts of your body. I may also use other instruments in the session. Following the session, we will have a brief review and discuss progress. If you are unable to lie on a massage table/plinth or if you use a walking aid or wheelchair for mobility, Sound Healing Therapy can be carried out in a chair or wheelchair.
              </p>
              <p>
                At the end of the healing session, I will ensure you are present and back in your body before leaving.
              </p>

              <p><strong>How often should I receive Sound Healing Therapy?</strong></p>
              <p>
                It is recommended to receive at least six weekly sound healing therapy sessions consecutively to work through the issue. The reason for this is to allow the sound and vibrations work within your body and break through the issues and blockages within your energy fields. A person may not notice a difference in the first or second week, therefore, the person should give their body time to adjust to the new vibrations and break down any blockages held. However, this is a recommendation and it is entirely up to the person how many sessions they attend.
              </p>

              <p><strong>Is there any situation where I cannot receive Sound Healing Therapy?</strong></p>
              <p>
                You cannot receive Sound Healing Therapy if you are currently receiving Cancer Treatment, or within trimester one of pregnancy.
              </p>
              <p>
                If you have Trigeminal Neuralgia Sound Healing Therapy cannot be given around the head area of the body.
              </p>
              <p>
                If you are being treated for a serious physical or mental disorder or are taking medications, before you make an appointment, you are required to provide a letter signed by your Medical Doctor stating that they have no objections to you receiving Sound Healing Treatment.

              <p><strong>What is Shamanism?</strong></p>
              <p>
                Shamanism is a way of life, Healing and Ceremony.
              </p>
              <p>
                The name Shaman comes from the Tungus region of Siberia. It is the oldest spiritual practice dating back 400,000 years to Africa. The Shaman is a keeper of the Mystery teachings and is awake to the ever-changing world, in touch with the invisible realms. A Shaman can be called or can choose the calling to use their natural healing powers to bring balance between worlds. Spirit is translated through direct experience. The term Shamanism means to blend a range of tools of shamanic practices and one who walks between worlds.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Shaman through discernment, is able to apply intention to determine whether energies are malevolent or benevolent. The Shaman has been compared to a type of priest, but does not follow a book, or strict doctrine, or a single belief system. The Shaman depends on direct experience.
              </p>
              <p>
                The codices of Shamanism are naturally built into the DNA of every person, regardless of race or gender. The Shaman is in the business of restoring harmony to the individual, his/her family, society or environment.
              </p>
              <p>
                Shamanism is rooted within the forces of nature and the four directions, East, South, West and North. The Shaman is a fulcrum between heaven and earth.

                Andean Priests do not think of gaining possessions or the material world. They are not focused on cars, houses or material objects. They are concerned with energy, the infinite varieties of living energy called the "Kawsay Pacha". They know that every material object has a spirit or energetic aspect. Everything has consciousness, a bubble of living energy that permeates the material world.
              </p>
              <p>
                In Andean Shamanism, we learn about the collective belief system and the power of nature, how to communicate directly with the Kawasa Pacha. The role of the Shaman is to deepen their relationship to our Mother who feeds and cloths us and provides our homes; our Pachamama, the Cosmic and Earth Mother.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Andeans do not use the word "Shaman", instead, they use the name PAQO meaning Holy Man/Woman, an earth Priest or Medicine Healer, or the term Chacaruna, a light being who is a bridge between heaven and earth.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Andean Cosmos has three distinct levels of existence while Earth has its own energetic quality.
              </p>

              <p><strong>The three distinct levels are:</strong></p>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>The Hanaq Pacha</strong> — Superior/Upper world, inhabited by highly refined beings and energies, Masters and Angelic Consciousness.</li>
                <li><strong>The Kay Pacha</strong> — Middle World, the space we inhabit at the 3D level, including all material things, refined energy and heavy energies. In the Andean world, there is no concept of good, evil, only heavy and light.</li>
                <li><strong>The Ukhu Pacha</strong> — Lower world, the interior underworld which resides inside the earth, consisting of the collective unconscious and in each person.</li>
              </ul>

              <p><strong>What is a Shaman's role?</strong></p>
              <ul>
                <li>To bring harmony and balance to the areas of dissolution and chaos.</li>
                <li>To work in service to Mother Earth and the Cosmic Mother, Pachamama.</li>
                <li>To guide and Counsel.</li>
                <li>To heal and clear soul sickness.</li>
              </ul>

              <p>
                The word Shaman means anyone who carries out ceremony, healing, counselling and divinatory work.
              </p>

              <p><strong>The Shaman's path teaches:</strong></p>
              <ul>
                <li>To forgive ourselves and others</li>
                <li>To learn humility</li>
                <li>To express gratitude</li>
                <li>To give unconditionally through Ayni — Sacred reciprocity</li>
                <li>To love unconditionally through Munay — unconditional Devine love</li>
              </ul>

              <p>
                This is done with our Spirit Guides, Wisdom Keepers, Ancestors, Archetypes, Spirit Animals, using ceremonial practices including fire, healing rituals, journeying to balance the physical, mental, emotional and spiritual bodies with the aid of:-
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>Our Masa, which is our alter multiverse bundle.</li>
                <li>Healing the past with bloodlines.</li>
                <li>By finding who we are, to know thyself.</li>
              </ul>

              <p><strong>Mystical Andean Shamanism</strong></p>
              <p>
                A Mystical Andean Shaman, undertakes the role to be a service to Pachamama, Mother Earth, the Cosmos and others in need.
              </p>
              <p>
                Anyi Mystical Andean Shamanism follows the teachings of the Aymara and Qero Lineages of the High Andes. It is better described by emphasising a difference between the terms Shamanic and Mystical.
              </p>
              <p>
                The earlies peoples of the Andean culture the ones before the Inca, (The Huanca) and the first peoples in Peru the Aymaras, knew the importance of working co-creatively with the Divine Beings and with the Cosmic forces of nature. They spoke the first language of mankind, 'Runasimi' the language of the light beings (Solar and Stella), the Solar Brotherhoods. This knowledge is scattered throughout the Andes now, yet is available to those who will do it justice.
              </p>
              <p>
                In the 'modern world' it has become very hard to know ourselves, when we constantly aggrandise ourselves. We bargain or state our terms with the Devine, saying:-
              </p>
              <p>
                "I am now prepared to receive this or that", "I deserve better", "I am stuck". These types of statements or beliefs, show insincerity and a lack of humility. The teachings inform us that the birth and knowledge do not make us good people.
              </p>
              <p>
                The role of the Andean Master and Mystic Shaman is one of 'Service'. Being in service not only continues to teach us so much about ourselves via the inner and outer worlds of the self. It also shows us how to interact with the unseen and seemingly inanimate beings who are all around us. As an Andean &amp; Mystical Shaman, I do this in a unique way by working with the powerful chumpi khuyas.
              </p>
              <p>
                Chumpi khuyas are energetic companions that can activate, animate, and move energy within different grids of time, dimensions and portals. In this way, they are a synergy of energy exchanges. Chumpi stones are living beings. They talk to the Shaman if they listen very carefully. When working with each specific Chumpi Khuya, we explore the aspects which contain, a Cosmic, Spiritual, Human and Elemental connection via the elements of Earth, Air, Water and Fire which has a consciousness and are sentient, working more intimately with the Nusta's (Andean Goddesses) and the archtypes of the Andean traditions and ceremonies.
              </p>
              <p>
                A Shaman is one who embodies innate power to both manage and influence heavy and light energies or emotional states. Whether this is for his/her own personal healing or to track illness and misfortune to its cause for their clients. It is a different practice from using the altered state of consciousness which is more affiliated with Northern Europe and Siberian Shamans. The Andean Shamans uses a more gentle approach.
              </p>
              <p>
                A Mystic is one who can communicate directly with Deity and the other benign forces who control the Universe. The Mystic seeks a contemplative state and surrenders to obtain truths which are beyond the construct of the ordinary mind, absorbing into and working directly with nature and the natural world around us. The Mystical Shaman seeks a more profound and personal experiential path, so they are able to integrate with the 'other' realms/worlds via the 'Tree of Existence' or 'World Tree', as is the way of the Andeans.
              </p>
              <p>
                The path of the Mystic is one who establishes a true and swift contact with Divinity in different manifestations. S/he is one who understands the Divine principles and the cosmic forces of nature, seeing inti as the Great Intelligence within him/herself everywhere. The Andean Master and Mystic is the true sage and is initiated.
              </p>
              <p>
                As a Anyi Mystical Andean Shaman I use the healing traditions and ceremonies listed below, where the energy of the original wound of the current issue presented may be tracked and transmuted. The original wound or issue may be personal, ancestral, past life or soul contract related, or a combination of two or more. These traditional rituals and ceremonies are carried out with spiritual guidance from the Architypes, Guides, Spirit, Animal Spirit Guides, Ancestors, Ancient and Wise ones and more. With Shamanic healing, the client not only heals themselves, but seven ancestral generations behind and seven generations to come.

                Emotional and Metaphysical Kinesiology (EMK) was founded by Denise Robinson, Melbourne, Australia and who is an IICT recognised Training Provider.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Emotional and Metaphysical Kinesiology TM and modality (EMK) is a fully accredited certification and recognised with the esteemed 'International Institute for Complementary Therapists' (IICT) as a Premier Training Provider under 'Specialised Kinesiology'
              </p>

              <p><strong>How does an EMK Practitioner work with the client?</strong></p>
              <p>
                I practice with the use of specific advanced and unique EMK balancing protocols for the nervous system, immune system, self-esteem, sabotage programs, money and abundance, love, fixations, reactivity, cross patterning, brain and more.
              </p>
              <p>
                As the client, you will be assisted in your own healing journey, bringing you back into balance in Mind, Body and Spirit, enabling you to empower yourself and live your life to the full, raising your consciousness on all levels.
              </p>
              <p>
                During your healing journey, your whole being is brought into balance through natural remedies, natures healing chi, Kinesiology techniques and healing tools identified by the clients subconscious by means of muscle testing, resulting in profound change for the client in mind, body and soul.
              </p>

              <p><strong>Muscle Testing</strong></p>
              <p>
                The scientific basis for manual muscle testing to assess neurological issues was developed by Boston Orthopaedic Surgeon R.W. Lovette and Wilhelmine Wright in the early 20th century initially for polio patients where he identified weak muscles linked to spinal nerves. In 1964, muscle testing was pioneered by Chiropractor George J. Goodheart Junior who founded Applied Kinesiology in 1964. He linked muscle weakness to organ function. In the 1970s, John Diamond, an Australian Psychiatrist who developed Behavioural Kinesiology connected muscle strength to emotions and energy. Later in the 1980s, Richard Utt developed applied Physiology, expanding on Kinesiology with acupressure and other techniques.
              </p>
              <p>
                Muscle reflex testing is a natural bio-feedback mechanism which supplies information via the nerve pathways and meridian systems of the brain and body, known as the subconscious. Our subconscious holds our memories, beliefs, life's stories and information about our physical, emotional, mental and spiritual being.
              </p>
              <p>
                Muscle testing is used with all the body's energy systems such as brain, spine, nervous system, immune system, organs, eyes, five elements, meridians, eight extraordinary meridians, major and minor chakras and auras. EMK taps into the activity of all the senses of perception, sight, touch, smell, taste, sound and intuition which in turn brings awareness to blocks and heightens the balance and healing experience. This unique modality also delves into the metaphors and metaphysical energy of any physical pain, symptoms or dis-ease as well as everyday stresses or triggers of daily life.
              </p>
              <p>
                By using muscle reflex testing and applying a range of non-invasive and gentle, yet powerful techniques, we are able to instantly access holistic information held by the subconscious to identify and locate energy blockages, stresses and imbalances within our physical and metaphysical being.
              </p>
              <p>
                The uses of muscle testing enables me to tap into the subconscious mind to identify stored and/or trapped emotions held within the body as a result of stress or trauma, as well as any physical or emotional stressors that need to be processed and cleared to from the whole being on all levels – Physical, Emotional, Mental and Spiritual.
              </p>

              <div class="quote-block">
                <p class="quote">
                  Everything is energy, energy is everything. Your body reflects your thoughts, feelings, attitudes, behaviours &amp; emotions, and so, emotional stress is stored and reflected in your body. Kinesiology can reduce stress, increase energy, alleviate pain and support new behaviours that improve health, well-being and vitality on all levels – Mind, Body &amp; Soul.

              </div>

              <p><strong>Why is EMK unique compared to other Kinesiology Modalities?</strong></p>
              <p>
                EMK is a unique Yin and science based, heart centred natural modality. The EMK modality relies on effective muscle testing to tap into the subconscious mind with the principals of working with the Traditional Chinese Medicine philosophies and researched modality (Eastern Medicine), blended with an emotional and metaphysical outlook that connects mind, body and spirit.
              </p>
              <p>
                It assesses energy and body function throughout the entire mind and body system that ultimately clears stress, fear, trauma, pain, negative patterns, limiting beliefs, sabotage programs or any mental and/or emotional stress from the physical, mental, emotional and spiritual bodies with a strong emphasis and focus on energetics, emotions and the metaphysical energy, with connections with the body. This emotional connection is what differentiates EMK from other Kinesiology modalities that are focused solely on the physical structure of the body, with a heavy lean to the yang western medicine format.
              </p>
              <p>
                What differentiates Emotional and Metaphysical Kinesiology (EMK) to other Kinesiology modalities is that in EMK, the answers, remedies and healing comes from within the client, not from the practitioner or an external source, as the whole universe and the answers to all is within ourselves. As a practicing Emotional and Metaphysical Kinesiologist, my role is to facilitate the client access the answers and provide support in their healing.
              </p>
              <p>
                As all physical symptoms showing up in a person's body have an underlying emotional connection, Emotions Metaphysical Kinesiology allows the body's own natural innate healing energy to assist in dissolving the physical symptoms of dis-ease and illness. This in turn brings the body back into a state of equilibrium, creating more energy, motivation and elevating your spirit, so you can nurture and build your best life.
              </p>
              <p>
                We are far more than our physical body. The human mind, body, spirit is a fascinating and powerful creation with extraordinary potential which is most often not tapped into. It has a complete intricate intelligence of its own with each element of mind, body and spirit making up three complete components which must be able to support each other in order to function and survive. Our bodies hold all the emotional, physical, spiritual, memory and belief as well as genetic records of this lifetime, past lifetimes and our ancestral lineage.
              </p>
              <p>
                When there is physical pain, dis-ease, negative thoughts, anxiety, stress or any type of physical or emotional symptoms, this is the bodies way of indicating a block in a person's energy system. Within the Chinese Medicine belief system, physical symptoms are simply manifestations of emotional imbalances.
              </p>
              <p>
                Kinesiology does not just deal with or mask the symptoms, but instead, focuses on clearing the root cause of the emotional imbalance and/or symptoms through the subconscious mind. We shift or clear the cause/imbalance and create optimal flow of the bodies energy system which brings the body back to equilibrium – state of balance and harmony.
              </p>

              <div class="quote-block">
                <p class="quote">
                  Kinesiology is quick and specific in identifying the underlying cause and determining the best remedy to resolve the issue and put your body back into balance, resulting in changes on all levels, structural, emotional, nutritional, psychological, energetic and spiritual, enabling your body to naturally heal itself and aligning you to your truth and the true essence that lives within you.

              <p><strong>Our Philosophy</strong></p>
              <div class="quote-block">
                <p class="quote">
                  In EMK we believe that the only way to truly heal pain, stress, fear, trauma, resentment, and other big emotions is to FEEL the emotion and process any triggers related to the pain, so the body can heal. Every physical symptom has an underlying emotion attached to it. By tapping into the emotions, hidden under any stress, pain or dis-ease, and processing them, we are able to clear old patterns, limiting beliefs, sabotage programs, emotional stressors and shift physical symptoms from the body, which enable the body to naturally and innately heal itself. Where other modalities primarily focus on the structural system of the body, our unique healing modality focuses on the heart and mind, emotions, metaphysical energy and deep client connection.

              <p><strong>What happens in a Kinesiology Session?</strong></p>
              <p>
                Every Kinesiology session is unique in their own right, as each session peels different layers and clears different issues which come up in the session in line with the Clients goal or intention. It is important to note that the Client is always responsible and in control of their own healing and following through on integrating any remedies that may show up as part of their clinic session.

                In an Emotional and Metaphysical Kinesiology clinic session, I will use muscle reflex testing to tap into the clients subconscious mind to shift trapped, stagnant or blocked energy held within the clients body which may be the source of any illness, or dis-ease, clearing pain stress and trauma held within the mental, emotional, physical and spiritual bodies as well as clearing limited beliefs, blockages, negative repetitive patterns, self-sabotage and returning the mental, emotional physical and spiritual bodies of the client back into balance, assisting the Client follow their own truth and lifepath.
              </p>
              <p>
                During a Kinesiology session, the Mind, Body, Spirit is brought into balance by muscle testing the Client, therefore, it is the Clients own body/muscle testing that determines what needs to be cleared and brought back into balance with the remedies, also indicated by means of muscle testing and in line with the Client's goal in the session.
              </p>
              <p>
                There are a number of balancing techniques, protocols and remedies which may test up for the Client during their Clients clinic session which they may be required to integrate into their life by means of home reinforcement, restoring harmony and balance. These include:-

              <p>
                Upon your arrival, you will be required to complete a new client consultation form, have a brief discussion of the issues you wish to address and will also discuss your goal/intention, what you want to achieve in the session and your future, all of which will be confidential. If it is your second or subsequent session, I will complete a client session sheet to monitor your progress.
              </p>
              <p>
                Once we have identified what you want to achieve in the session with your goal/intention you will lie on your back, fully clothed on a massage table/plinth. Then I use your arm muscle to indicate and tap into your subconscious mind to provide me with information from your body as it responds to the information I test for. These can be thoughts, emotions, or other information/symptoms. If the session is carried out on-line I muscle test through surrogate muscle testing.
              </p>
              <p>
                I also use this muscle testing technique to check which area of the body is the priority to work with during the session and where the imbalances are held in your body. Your body, through the subconscious mind provides me with the best remedy required for you to bring you back into balance in Mind, Body &amp; Spirit. So, each session and remedy is specific to you and your issues/imbalances/goal we have previously discussed and which you identified at the beginning of the session. Any emotions/energy brought up during the session is brought back into balance in conjunction with the subconscious, and the remedies your body has identified, allowing your energy field to heal itself, bring your energy fields back into balance and allow you achieve the goal you set out at the start of the session. This is your journey, and you are in charge.
              </p>

              <p><strong>How often will I need a Kinesiology session?</strong></p>
              <p>
                Firstly, each persons journey to self-discovery and clearing blockages, traumas and dis-ease is unique. If you are willing to honour yourself and your own commitment to your journey, you must be present and take part in your own healing during each clinic session and follow through on any post clinic session advice your own sub-conscious provides in order to clear the challenges which are showing up for you.
              </p>
              <p>
                Each clinic session is a peeling back and healing of a layer of conditioning and returning you to your true essence, so the number of clinic sessions depends on you, how long you have had the stress or symptom(s), how well your body responds, as well as your own commitment to yourself. How far you want to take your own personal journey to change your life in this lifetime and the next depends on you.
              </p>
              <p>
                In general, it can take up to six weekly Kinesiology sessions to get to the source of an issue and clear a particular imbalance, stress or symptom.
              </p>
              <p>
                As the imbalances or issues are cleared and layers of conditioning is removed, you will feel a shift in your energy and it may reveal other or deeper issues or layers of imbalances or goals that you may wish to clear or achieve as part of your growth and journey. You are in charge of your own healing and journey.
              </p>
              <p>
                As progress is made through the issues and the persons life returns to balance, it is recommended that routine Emotional and Metaphysical Kinesiology clinic sessions are maintained between every four to six weeks to maintain a balance and empowerment in Mind, Body, Soul, and to continue shedding the old patterns and blockages. However, it is totally up to each person how many sessions and how often they wish to have a session.

              Please note a booking of an appointment is NOT a confirmation of your appointment. Your appointment is not confirmed until you receive a
              confirmation in writing from Sanctuary of Solace.
            </p>

          <h3 style="color: var(--blue); margin: 24px 0 10px;">Booking your appointment</h3>
          <p>
            If you are a new client, it is recommended that when booking your initial appointment, you also book in your follow up appointment/s due
            to potential waiting times. New clients are requested to arrive at least 05 minutes prior to your appointment time to complete the New Client
            Consultation Form. Once an appointment is made, Sanctuary of Solace will contact you directly to clarify and confirm the modality you wish to
            receive.
          </p>

          <h3 style="color: var(--blue); margin: 24px 0 10px;">Time keeping - Arriving for your scheduled appointment</h3>
          <p>
            Whether your scheduled appointment is in person, on-line or distant, please arrive 05 minutes in advance of your scheduled appointment.
            Out of respect of other clients and the Practitioner, late arrivals will result in you not benefiting from the full session and your
            scheduled appointment will be cut short so that the next clients appointment starts on time and you will be charged for the full amount.
          </p>

          <div class="notice">
            <h3>Cancellation Policy and Fees</h3>
            <p>Cancellation fees will be applied where:-</p>
            <ul>
              <li>A 'no show' or cancellation less than 24 hours from the time of the scheduled appointment will result in a cancellation fee of 25% of the initial fee being added to any future session.</li>
              <li>Cancellation on the day of the booked appointment will incur a cancellation fee of the full amount (the day being noted as commencing at 00.01 of the appointment day).</li>
              <li>Cancellation fees will be required to be paid within 48 hours prior to any future appointment.</li>
              <li>If the potential client has paid the fee in full, in advance of the booked appointment, Sanctuary of Solace reserves the right to retain the full fee depending on the scenarios above.</li>
              <li>Sanctuary of Solace reserves the right to cancel appointments at short notice in the event of any unforeseen circumstances. If such an event occurs, no cancellation fee as above will apply.</li>
            </ul>
          </div>

          <p>
            If you are feeling unwell and unable to attend for your booked appointment, your appointment can be easily changed to an on-line session or distance healing
            where relevant, which works equally well as in person depending on the therapy booked. This is an effective method to avoid a cancellation
            fee and you will also receive the required support. Please note, only Reiki and Emotional and Metaphysical Kinesiology can be provided
            on-line. Reiki can also be provided through distance healing.
          </p>
          <p>
            The above applies to all modalities and appointments, including initial consultation bookings.

            making an appointment if payment is a cash payment.
          </p>
