            Each session is tailored to your story. These modalities peel back layers of conditioning and stress,
            tracking the energy to the source of old patterns, trauma, addiction, physical, mental, emotional pain and
            suffering; some which may not even be yours, but may be tracked back to and through your ancestral lineage, 
            the womb, past lives and even the land on which you live. It is by identifying the source of these issues,
            acknowledging, releasing, healing and transforming this energy that enables you to change your energetic
            blueprint. Energy can never be destroyed, but it can be changed. It doesn't mean you will forget, but it
            will enable you to understand what's yours and what is not, and the reason for the event, see it from a 
            higher perspective and to look at them objectively, and react differently in the future.
          </p>

          <p>
            These are not hollow words. These words I write are truth, my truth. From the one who has walked the path,
            experienced the terrors of the night and fears that plagued the day, to the point that one no longer wanted
            to exist in any form; in this life or the next, but to vanish into the abyss of non-existence. To the one
            who experienced, no-one will ever know or comprehend this long and lonely journey. Today, this one stands
            in the light, without the terrors and fears, without the shackles of trauma caused to the ancestral lineage,
            the womb, life and land, all woven so intricately within the energy field. Looking back, no greater honour
            has it been than to heal my ancestral lineage, of those gone before me, those coming after me and to our land.

              A "healer" never heals anyone directly. A "healer" gives off a vibration representing the healed state and channels
              sacred divine energy from source by whatever technique they prefer. It is up to the person requiring the healing to
              match that frequency in order to heal themselves. It is the responsibility of the person requiring healing to accept
              the "healers" energy and match that frequency by mirroring that energy and/or accepting the channelled sacred divine
              source energy in order to heal themselves.

            FREE YOUR SPIRIT AND RECLAIM YOUR TRUE ESSENCE
          </p>

          <p>
            Hi, my name is James and you are welcome to my website. Growing up in the countryside, spending most of my days in 
            nature and with animals I feel significantly contributed to my sensitivity to energy. I consider myself as a 
            compassionate, empathic, intuitive and sensitive being.
          </p>

          <p>
            I believe that everything is created equal and that we were created to be happy and healthy, to enjoy life with the 
            responsibility as caretakers of this beautiful planet that has been gifted to us. I believe each illness and dis-ease 
            is caused by emotions, traumas and environmental imbalances from this lifetime, past lives and/or inherited through 
            our ancestral lineage and energy fields.
          </p>

          <p>
            I have always been drawn to spirituality, the unseen, the mysteries of life and the universe. I have considerable 
            knowledge and living experiences of mental, emotional and spiritual pain, personal and ancestral trauma and the impact 
            that traumatised land can have on our behaviour and health.
          </p>

          <p>
            I believe that we have been gifted with the power and tools to heal ourselves, our ancestral energy lines and the 
            planet through plant medicine, crystals, sound, colour, animals and energy healing. Everything is energy and we are 
            far more than our physical bodies.
          </p>

          <p>
            In order to heal, we must also acknowledge and forgive ourselves and others without judgement. It is my belief that 
            no-one heals another. The whole universe and the Source of all creation is within each one of us and our healing 
            comes from within.
          </p>

          <p>
            As a practitioner and facilitator, I will hold sacred space for you, to help you heal your emotional, mental, 
            physical and spiritual pain, peel back the many layers of conditioning, reclaim your power, your authenticity, 
            your sovereignty and facilitate you in your own healing.
          </p>

            <div class="modality-body">

              <p><strong>Origins of Crystal Healing</strong></p>
              <p>
                Crystal healing practices originated in ancient civilisations, such as Ancient Lemuria, Atlantis, Mesopotamia, Egypt, India and China where crystals were used for protection, spiritual purposes, and to enhance well-being. Crystals were also used, and continue to be used today in many ancient traditional cultures such as the Mayans, Shaman Medicine people across many continents including the Indigenous of Peru and North America. Modern crystal healing has been built on these ancient practices and traditions over thousands of years.
              </p>

              <p><strong>What is Crystal Healing?</strong></p>
              <p>
                Crystal healing is a natural energy healing therapy that is carried out with the assistance of the Angelic-Elemental beings of Holy Light and Love, Archangel Sandalphon who is the Prince or Governor of the Angelic-Elemental Kingdom. It is channelled from the Source of all life with the assistance of Angels, Spirit Guides and the client's Higher Self through the practitioner to the client with the use of crystals placed on various parts of the client's body.
              </p>
              <p>
                It gently balances life energies and brings health and well-being. This is a non-invasive healing therapy which works to promote health and well-being of the physical, emotional and spiritual bodies.
              </p>

              <p><strong>What should I expect in a Crystal Healing Session?</strong></p>
              <p>
                Prior to a crystal healing session, I will tune in with Spirit, mine and your guides, angels, your higher self, tuning into your energy field to seek guidance.
              </p>
              <p>
                Before you arrive, I will have opened Sacred Space and have the space cleansed and spiritually protected. Upon your arrival, you will be required to complete a new client questionnaire session form and have a brief discussion of the issues you wish to address, all of which will be confidential. You will then lie face up on the massage table/plinth (fully clothed) where I will enter your auric energy field, scan your body with my hands hovering over your energy field after which I will commence crystal healing placing specific crystals on the areas of the body that is required.
              </p>
              <p>
                At the end of the healing session, I will remove the crystals and their connection to you, clear your aura and perform grounding, ensuring you are present and back in your body before leaving.
              </p>

              <p><strong>How does Crystal Healing work?</strong></p>
              <p>
                As a Crystal Healing Practitioner, I will not use my own personal energy, I will only use Angelic Elemental of Holy Light and Love Divine healing energy. I will take in the Angelic Elemental Holy Light and Love Divine healing energy through my crown chakra, into my heart chakra and direct this healing out through my hands and channel the healing energy through the crystals which enhances and magnifies healing energy into your energy field.
              </p>
              <p>
                Crystal healing automatically balances the blocked energy pathways within the physical, emotional, mental and spiritual bodies. Following the crystal healing session, the healing energy becomes integrated into the energy field of the client over the following three to five days where more may be released from the client's energy field and the process is then repeated.
              </p>

              <p><strong>How often should I receive Crystal Healing?</strong></p>
              <p>
                It is recommended to receive a minimum of six healing sessions, one healing per week for a minimum of six consecutive weeks to work through the particular issue. Each issue is different and depending on the issue, length of time and depth of the issue more than six healing sessions may be required.
              </p>

              <p>
                Reiki is a Japanese word that means Universal Energy. In Japan over 100 years ago, Dr. Usui was given initiations into healing in a consciousness-raising experience he had. The proof of his experience was that the "Reiki" initiations he was given worked.
              </p>
              <p>
                Tera Mai Reiki is a natural energy healing therapy that is channelled from the Source of all life with the assistance of Angels, Spirit Guides and the client's Higher Self through the practitioner to the client. It gently balances life energies and brings health and well-being focusing on the seven major chakras, spin points, vents and the aura. This is a non-invasive healing therapy which works to promote health and well-being of the physical, emotional and spiritual bodies.

              <p><strong>Tera Mai Reiki Seichem</strong></p>
              <p>
                Traditional Reiki Seichem passes down fire energy with the grounding qualities of Earth (Reiki). Tera-Mai Seichem Practitioners are initiated into all four elements of Earth, Fire, Water and Air.
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Earth (Reiki)</strong> - healing energy grounds all other healing energies</li>
                <li><strong>Fire (Sakara)</strong> - works in the aura as well as the physical body</li>
                <li><strong>Water (Sophi-El)</strong> - brings up deep emotional issues for healing</li>
                <li><strong>Air (Angelic-light)</strong> - is a two-fold energy of air and Spirit. It aids in psychological healing. It also enhances the power of the third eye and the spoken word.</li>
              </ul>

              <p><strong>Psychic Surgery</strong></p>
              <p>
                Psychic surgery utilises other rays of touch healing. It is a non-invasive profound and transformative healing technique within the realm of Reiki. Unlike conventional surgery, psychic surgery operates on an energetic level. It may target imbalances, blockages and physical issues in the body and its subtle energy system.
              </p>
              <p>
                The practitioner tunes into the universal life force energy, their intuition and Spirit guides, identifies areas of the body with imbalances, blockages or physical issues the client presents themselves with. Using gentle hand movements and visual tools provided by the practitioner's Spirit guides, the practitioner may manipulate or remove the negative energy or dissolve the physical issue and restore balance to the area.
              </p>

              <p><strong>How does Reiki work?</strong></p>
              <p>
                As a Reiki Practitioner, I will not use my own personal energy, I will only use Divine healing energy. I will take in the Divine energy healing through my crown chakra, into my heart chakra and direct this healing out through my hands and channel the healing energy into your energy field.
              </p>

              <p><strong>Benefits of Reiki</strong></p>

              <p><strong>What should I expect in a Reiki Healing Session?</strong></p>
              <p>
                Prior to a Reiki healing session I will tune in with Spirit, my and your Spirit guides, angels, your higher self, tuning into your energy field to seek guidance. Before you arrive, I will have opened Sacred Space and have the space cleansed and spiritually protected. Upon your arrival, you will be required to complete a new client questionnaire session form. You will then lie face up on the massage table/plinth (fully clothed) where I will enter your auric energy field, scan your body with my hands hovering over your energy field after which I will commence Reiki healing.
              </p>

              <p><strong>How often should I receive Reiki Healing?</strong></p>
              <p>
                It is recommended to receive a minimum of six healing sessions, one healing per week for a minimum of six consecutive weeks to work through the particular issue. Each issue is different and depending on the issue, more sessions may be required.

              <p><strong>Sound and Vibration</strong></p>
              <p>
                Everything in the Universe vibrates at a certain frequency, the earth, moon, stars and all that exists. Everything is a vibration, our bodies have a whole number of rhythms, nothing stays still. The motion generates frequencies which then generate sound, resulting in everything, including the cells in our bodies having a resonant sound and frequency even though it may not be heard by the human ear.
              </p>
              
              <div class="quote-block">
                <p class="quote">
                  Each celestial body, in fact, each and every atom, produces the particular sound on account of its movement, its rhythm or vibration. All these sounds have vibrations from a universal harmony, in which each element, while having its own function and character, contributes to the whole.
                </p>

              </div>

              <p>
                Sound therapy, or sound healing, uses sound waves and vibrations to promote deep relaxation, reduce stress, and improve overall well-being. Based on the principle that everything in the universe vibrates at a unique frequency, it aims to bring a person's natural resonance back into healthy balance by using therapeutic sounds from instruments like singing bowls, gongs, chimes, drums and voice.
              </p>

              <p><strong>Origins of Sound Healing Therapy</strong></p>
              <p>
                Sound Healing Therapy is one of the oldest forms of healing known to mankind.

                <li><strong>Shaman Medicine People:</strong> Shamans use sound healing to induce trance states for healing and spiritual journeys by employing instruments like drums and rattles to create rhythmic vibrations.</li>
              </ul>

              <p><strong>Benefits of Sound Healing Therapy</strong></p>
              <p>Benefits can include:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Pain relief and sports injury recovery</li>

                <li>Brain hemisphere balancing</li>
              </ul>

              <p><strong>Instruments Used</strong></p>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Singing Bowls:</strong> Tibetan and crystal singing bowls create resonant vibrations that promote relaxation, focus, and peace.</li>
                <li><strong>Gongs:</strong> Provide deep resonance and relaxation.</li>
                <li><strong>Drums:</strong> Create a rhythmic, heartbeat-like sound associated with the earth and physical healing.</li>
                <li><strong>Chimes, Rattles and Flutes:</strong> Used to create therapeutic soundscapes and enhance the sacred space.</li>
                <li><strong>Chanting and Singing:</strong> The human voice is a powerful tool for producing resonant healing frequencies.</li>
              </ul>

              <p><strong>What should I expect in a Sound Healing Session?</strong></p>
              <p>
                Before you arrive, I will have opened Sacred Space and have the space cleansed. Upon your arrival, you will be required to complete a new client questionnaire session form and have a brief discussion of the issues you wish to address, all of which will be confidential. You will then lie face down on the massage table/plinth (fully clothed) where I will proceed to perform the treatment, placing the sound therapy bowls on various parts of the body. You will then lie face up, where I will also place the sound therapy bowls on various parts of your body. I may also use other instruments in the session.
              </p>
              <p>
                If you are unable to lie on a massage table/plinth or if you use a walking aid or wheelchair for mobility, Sound Healing Therapy can be carried out in a chair or wheelchair.
              </p>

              <p><strong>How often should I receive Sound Healing Therapy?</strong></p>
              <p>
                It is recommended to receive at least six weekly sound healing therapy sessions consecutively for each issue to work through the issue. The reason for this is to allow the sound and vibrations break through the issues and blockages within the body. A person may not notice a difference in the first or second week, therefore, the person should give their body time to adjust and break down any blockages held.
              </p>

              <p><strong>Important Medical Requirements</strong></p>
              <p>
                You cannot receive Sound Healing Therapy if you are currently receiving Cancer Treatment, or within trimester one of pregnancy. If you have Trigeminal neuralgia, Sound Healing Therapy cannot be given around the head area of the body.
              </p>
              <p>
                If you are being treated for a serious physical or mental disorder or are taking medications, before you make an appointment, you are required to provide a letter signed by your Medical Doctor stating that they have no objections to you receiving Sound Healing Treatment.

              <p><strong>What is Shamanism?</strong></p>
              <p>
                Shamanism is a way of life, Healing and Ceremony. The name Shaman comes from the Tungus region of Siberia. It is the oldest spiritual practice dating back 400,000 years to Africa. The Shaman is a keeper of the Mystery teachings and is awake to the ever-changing world, in touch with the invisible realms.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Shaman is in the business of restoring harmony to the individual, his/her family, society or environment. Shamanism is rooted within the forces of nature and the four directions. The Shaman is a fulcrum between heaven and earth.
              </p>

              <p><strong>What is Andean Shamanism?</strong></p>
              <p>
                In Andean Shamanism, we learn about the collective belief system and the power of nature, how to communicate directly with the Kawsay Pacha (living energy). The role of the Shaman is to deepen their relationship to our Mother who feeds and clothes us and provides our homes - Pachamama, the Cosmic and Earth Mother.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Andeans do not use the word "Shaman", instead, they use the name PAQO meaning Holy Man/Woman, an earth Priest or Medicine Healer.
              </p>

              <p><strong>The Three Distinct Levels of Andean Cosmos:</strong></p>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Hanaq Pacha</strong> – Superior/Upper world, inhabited by highly refined beings and energies, Masters and Angelic Consciousness</li>
                <li><strong>Kay Pacha</strong> – Middle World, the space we inhabit at the 3D level, including all material things, refined energy and heavy energies</li>
                <li><strong>Ukhu Pacha</strong> – Lower world, the interior underworld which resides inside the earth consisting of the collective unconscious</li>
              </ul>

              <p><strong>What is a Shaman's role?</strong></p>
              <ul>
                <li>To bring harmony and balance to the areas of dissolution and chaos</li>
                <li>To work in service to Mother Earth and the Cosmic Mother, Pachamama</li>
                <li>To guide and counsel</li>
                <li>To heal and clear soul sickness</li>
              </ul>

              <p><strong>The Shaman's path teaches:</strong></p>
              <ul>
                <li>To forgive ourselves and others</li>
                <li>To learn humility</li>
                <li>To express gratitude</li>
                <li>To give unconditionally through Ayni – Sacred reciprocity</li>
                <li>To love unconditionally through Munay – unconditional Divine love</li>
              </ul>

              <p><strong>Mystical Andean Shamanism</strong></p>
              <p>
                A Mystical Andean Shaman undertakes the role to be of service to Pachamama, Mother Earth, the Cosmos and Others in need. As an Ayni Mystical Andean Shaman I use the healing traditions and ceremonies where the energy of the original wound or current issue presented may be tracked and transmuted. The original wound or issue may be personal, ancestral, past life or soul contract related.
              </p>
              <p>
                Traditional rituals and ceremonies are carried out with spiritual guidance from the Archetypes, Guides, Spirit, Animal Spirit Guides, Ancestors, Ancient and Wise ones. With Shamanic healing, the client not only heals themselves, but seven ancestral generations behind and seven generations to come.
              </p>

              <p><strong>Traditional rituals and ceremonies include:</strong></p>
              <ul>
                <li>Nature Medicine</li>
                <li>Fire Ceremony</li>
                <li>Clearing and illuminating the seven major chakras</li>

        <h2 class="section-title">Cancellation Policy, Appointments and Pricing</h2>
        <div class="prose">
          <p>
            There is considerable preparation and time spent by Sanctuary of Solace and/or its practitioners in preparing for each client in advance.
            Sanctuary of Solace is committed to providing professional personalised services and care to all clients. Client's time is precious and
            respected and the same is expected in return.
          </p>
          <p>
            You are advised to read the modality service you require in the relevant modality section on this website prior to booking an appointment. 
            Please note, booking an appointment is not a confirmation of your appointment. Your appointment is not confirmed until you receive a 
            confirmation in writing.
          </p>

          <div class="notice">
            <h3>Appointments</h3>
            <p>
              Please note a booking of an appointment is NOT a confirmation of your appointment. Sanctuary of Solace will be in contact with you to 
              confirm the closest appointment time available to suite your request.
            </p>
          </div>

          <h3 style="color: var(--blue); margin: 24px 0 10px;">Booking your appointment</h3>
          <p>
            If you are a new client, it is recommended that when booking your initial appointment, you also book in your follow up appointment/s due
            to potential waiting times. New clients are requested to arrive at least 05 minutes prior to your appointment time to complete the New Client
            Consultation Form. Once an appointment is made, Sanctuary of Solace will contact you directly to clarify and confirm the modality you wish to
            receive.
          </p>

          <!-- HIDDEN: Courtesy Reminders (client might forget to send) -->
          <!--
          <h3 style="color: var(--blue); margin: 24px 0 10px;">Courtesy Reminders</h3>
          <p>
            When making an appointment with Sanctuary of Solace you will receive a courtesy reminder three days prior your appointment.
          </p>
          -->

          <h3 style="color: var(--blue); margin: 24px 0 10px;">Time keeping - Arriving for your scheduled appointment</h3>
          <p>
            Whether your scheduled appointment is in person, on-line or distant, please arrive 05 minutes in advance of your scheduled appointment. 
            Out of respect of other clients and the Practitioner, late arrivals will result in you not benefiting from the full session and your 
            scheduled appointment will be cut short so that the next client's appointment starts on time and you will be charged for the full amount.
          </p>

          <div class="notice">
            <h3>Cancellation Policy and Fees</h3>
            <p>Cancellation fees will be applied where:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>A 'no show' or cancellation less than 24 hours from the time of the scheduled appointment will result in a cancellation fee of 25% of the initial fee being added to any future session.</li>
              <li>Cancellation on the day of the booked appointment will incur a cancellation fee of the full amount (the day being noted as commencing at 00.01 of the appointment day).</li>
              <li>Cancellation fees will be required to be paid within 48 hours, prior to any future appointment and the appointment fee paid in person immediately following the session.</li>
              <li>If the potential client has paid the fee in full in advance of the booked appointment, Sanctuary of Solace reserves the right to retain the full fee depending on the scenarios above.</li>
              <li>Sanctuary of Solace reserves the right to cancel appointments at short notice in the event of any unforeseen circumstances. If such an event occurs, no cancellation fee as above will apply.</li>
            </ul>
          </div>

          <p>
            If you are unwell to attend for your booked appointment your appointment can be easily changed to an on-line session or distance healing 
            where relevant, which works equally well as in person depending on the therapy booked. This is an effective method to avoid a cancellation 
            fee and you will also receive the required support. Please note, only Reiki and Emotional and Metaphysical Kinesiology can be provided 
            on-line. Reiki can also be provided through distance healing.
          </p>
          <p>
            The above applies to all modalities and appointments, including initial consultation bookings.
          </p>

          <h3 style="color: var(--blue); margin: 24px 0 10px;">Payment and Payment Methods</h3>
          
          <h4 style="color: var(--orange); margin: 18px 0 8px;">Non cash payments</h4>
          <p>
            Non cash payments must be made when booking an appointment, are not refundable or transferable. Non cash payments are accepted by Revolut,
            Electronic Funds Transfer to a nominated bank account and PayPal. Please note, if making payment by any of these methods please contact 
            Sanctuary of Solace immediately by email after you make the appointment for details.
          </p>
          <p>
            Please note that a bank/credit/debit card surcharge fee may be incurred with all visa and Mastercard payments.
          </p>
          <p>
            On-line or distant healing sessions must be paid and received in full in advance of any session.
          </p>

          <h4 style="color: var(--orange); margin: 18px 0 8px;">Cash payments</h4>
          <p>
            For cash payments, full payment is due at the end of each session. At present, there is no requirement to part pay or pay in full when
            making an appointment if payment is a cash payment.
          </p>

          <h4 style="color: var(--orange); margin: 18px 0 8px;">In person appointments</h4>
          <p>
            In person appointments must be paid on the day, immediately following the session with any previous cancellation fees paid within 48 hours of
            the scheduled appointment.
          </p>

          <h4 style="color: var(--orange); margin: 18px 0 8px;">On-line or distant appointments</h4>
          <p>
            On-line or distant healing sessions must be paid and received in full 48 hours in advance of any session. <strong>Please note, only Reiki and 
            Emotional and Metaphysical Kinesiology can be provided on-line. Reiki can also be provided through distance healing.</strong>
          </p>
