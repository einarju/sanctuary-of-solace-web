            Each session is tailored to your story. These modalities peel back layers of conditioning and stress,
            tracking the energy to the source of old patterns, trauma, addiction, physical mental emotional pain and
            suffering, some which may not even be yours, but may be tracked back to your ancestral lineage, the womb,
            past lives and even the land on which you live. It is by identifying the source of these issues,
            acknowledging, releasing, healing and transforming this energy that enables you to change your energetic
            blueprint. Energy can never be destroyed, but it can be changed. It doesn't mean you will forget, but it
            will enable you to understand what's yours and what is not, possibly the reason for the event and to look
            at them objectively, and react differently in the future.
          </p>

          <p>
            These are not hollow words. These words I write are truth, my truth. From the one who has walked the path,
            experienced the terrors of the night and fears that plagued the day to the point that one no longer wanted
            to exist in any form, in this life or the next, but to vanish into the abyss of non-existence. To the one
            who experienced, no-one will ever know or comprehend this long and lonely journey. Today, this one stands
            in the light, without the terros and fears, without the shackles of trauma caused to the ancestral lineage,
            the womb, life and land, all woven so intricately within the energy field. Looking back, no greater honour
            has it been than to heal the ancestral lineage, of those gone before me, those coming after me and to our land.

              match that frequency in order to heal themselves. It is the responsibility of the person requiring healing to accept
              the "healers" energy and match that frequency by mirroring that energy and/or accepting the channelled sacred divine

          <p>
            In order to heal, we must also acknowledge and forgive ourselves and others without judgement.
            It is my belief that no-one heals another—healing comes from within, as each of us carries the
            Source of all creation inside us.
          </p>

          <p>
            As a practitioner and facilitator, I hold sacred space for you to help you heal emotional,
            mental, physical and spiritual pain, peel back layers of conditioning, reclaim your power and
            authenticity, and support you to regain control of your life.

          <p>
            There is considerable preparation and time spent by Sanctuary of Solace and/or its practitioners in preparing for each client in advance.
            Sanctuary of Solace is committed to providing professional personalised services and care to all clients. Client's time is precious and
            respected and the same is expected in return.
          </p>
          <p>
            You are advised to read the modality service you require in the relevant modality section on this website prior to booking an appointment. 
            Please note, booking an appointment is not a confirmation of your appointment. Your appointment is not confirmed until you receive a 
            confirmation in writing.
          </p>

          <div class="notice">
            <h3>Appointments</h3>
            <p>
              Please note a booking of an appointment is NOT a confirmation of your appointment. Sanctuary of Solace will be in contact with you to 
              confirm the closest appointment time available to suite your request.
            </p>
          </div>

          <h3 style="color: var(--blue); margin: 24px 0 10px;">Booking your appointment</h3>
          <p>
            If you are a new client, it is recommended that when booking your initial appointment, you also book in your follow up appointment/s due
            to potential waiting times. New clients are requested to arrive at least 05 minutes prior to your appointment time to complete the New Client
            Consultation Form. Once an appointment is made, Sanctuary of Solace will contact you directly to clarify and confirm the modality you wish to
            receive.
          </p>

          <h3 style="color: var(--blue); margin: 24px 0 10px;">Courtesy Reminders</h3>
          <p>
            When making an appointment with Sanctuary of Solace you will receive a courtesy reminder three days prior your appointment.
          </p>

          <h3 style="color: var(--blue); margin: 24px 0 10px;">Time keeping - Arriving for your scheduled appointment</h3>
          <p>
            Whether your scheduled appointment is in person, on-line or distant, please arrive 05 minutes in advance of your scheduled appointment. 
            Out of respect of other clients and the Practitioner, late arrivals will result in you not benefiting from the full session and your 
            scheduled appointment will be cut short so that the next clients appointment starts on time and you will be charged for the full amount.
          </p>

          <div class="notice">
            <h3>Cancellation Policy and Fees</h3>
            <p>Cancellation fees will be applied where:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>A 'no show' or cancellation less than 24 hours from the time of the scheduled appointment will result in a cancellation fee of 25% of the initial fee being added to any future session.</li>
              <li>Cancellation on the day of the booked appointment will incur a cancellation fee of the full amount (the day being noted as commencing at 00.01 of the appointment day).</li>
              <li>Cancellation fees will be required to be paid within 48 hours, prior to any future appointment and the appointment fee paid in person immediately following the session.</li>
              <li>If the potential client has paid the fee in full in advance of the booked appointment, Sanctuary of Solace reserves the right to retain the full fee depending on the scenarios above.</li>
              <li>Sanctuary of Solace reserves the right to cancel appointments at short notice in the event of any unforeseen circumstances. If such an event occurs, no cancellation fee as above will apply.</li>
            </ul>
          </div>

          <p>
            If you are unwell to attend for your booked appointment your appointment can be easily changed to an on-line session or distance healing 
            where relevant, which works equally well as in person depending on the therapy booked. This is an effective method to avoid a cancellation 
            fee and you will also receive the required support. Please note, only Reiki and Emotional and Metaphysical Kinesiology can be provided 
            on-line. Reiki can also be provided through distance healing.
          </p>
          <p>
            The above applies to all modalities and appointments, including initial consultation bookings.
          </p>

          <h3 style="color: var(--blue); margin: 24px 0 10px;">Payment and Payment Methods</h3>
          
          <h4 style="color: var(--orange); margin: 18px 0 8px;">Non cash payments</h4>
          <p>

          </p>
          <p>
            Please note that a bank/credit/debit card surcharge fee may be incurred with all visa and Mastercard payments.
          </p>
          <p>
            On-line or distant healing sessions must be paid and received in full in advance of any session.
          </p>

          <h4 style="color: var(--orange); margin: 18px 0 8px;">Cash payments</h4>
          <p>
            For cash payments, full payment is due at the end of each session. At present, there is no requirement to part pay or pay in full in when
            making an appointment if payment is a cash payment.
          </p>

          <h4 style="color: var(--orange); margin: 18px 0 8px;">In person appointments</h4>
          <p>
            In person appointments must be paid on the day, immediately following the session with any previous cancellation fees paid within 48 hours of
            the scheduled appointment.
          </p>
